The Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI solution providing a 360° view of a bank’s lending operations.
It transforms raw loan data into actionable insights - tracking disbursements, repayments, delinquencies, and defaults; to help financial leaders make data-driven decisions.

The dashboard offers a unified view of portfolio performance, borrower behavior, and risk exposure across products, branches, and regions.

By integrating KPIs, trend analysis, and client-level drillthroughs, it enables management to:

* Monitor portfolio health in real time.

* Detect high-risk borrowers and delinquency patterns early.

* Improve branch and regional performance based on profitability and risk.
